My name is Ethan Catzel, and welcome to my **Infinite Learning** personal blog. This is a place where I make posts about various learning journeys I've embarked on. I believe writing about what I'm learning will actively help me solidify the learnings I pursue.

Disclaimer: as this is mostly intended for myself, I take occasional shortcuts with the content I post, such that it may be taken directly from a few websites. The main thing I make sure of is that I write content that I understand, and if an external website expresses themselves as clearly as possible, then I don't see the value in trying to reword it.
